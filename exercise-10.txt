Create a data model representing a Hotel with Floors and Rooms 🏨
This model should provide answers to the following questions:
The list of Rooms available for rent on a specific date
The list of Rooms which can be occupied by at least 3 people on a specific date
The amount of unrentable Rooms (janitor closets, public laundry room, gym, etc.)
The amount of Rooms having a private Kitchen
The average amount of windows per Floor
The amount of Floors having Rooms with carpets

CREATE TABLE floors (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT KEY
    rooms INT
);

CREATE TABLE rooms (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT KEY,
    floorId INT,
    rentable BOOLEAN,
    //vacant BOOLEAN,
    rentedOn DATETIME,
    rentedTill DATETIME,
    capacity INT,
    kitchen BOOLEAN,
    windows INT,
    carpeted BOOLEAN
);

// List of rooms available on a specific date = all rentable rooms where the searched-for date does not fall
// between the rentedOn and rentedTill dates entered.

// List of rooms that can have at least 3 people on a specific date = all rentable rooms where the searched-for date
// does not fall between the rentedOn and rentedTill dates and the capacity is >= 3

// Unrentable rooms = all rooms with a rentable value of false

// Rooms with kitchens = all rooms with a kitchen boolean value of true

// Average amount of windows per floor = average function on the number of windows per room added up,
// divided by the number of floors in the floor table (or unique floorIds in rooms table)

// Amount of floors with carpets = all rooms with a carpet boolean value of true
