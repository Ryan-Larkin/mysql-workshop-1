    birthday DATETIME,
    dateRemoved DATETIME
);

// dateRemoved was the date when the animal was removed from the barn

// what animals fit the criteria of your specific date being between the birthday 
// and the dateRemoved

// To find how many chicks will come to age on a specific date, search for which chicks have a birthday where
